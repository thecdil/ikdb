Often cited as a 'disaster' or 'opportunistic' species following extinction events, Tasmanites is instead considered a biotic proxy for anoxia and a resource or ""bottom-up"" control on biomass flow. Oligotrophic waters with large pools of reduced nitrogen (specifically, ammonium [NH₄⁺) promoted an optimal growth environment for prasinophytes whose modern representatives have large cellular quotas for reduced nitrogen. Cell growth in acritarchs was inhibited by heavy metal toxicity due to low cellular quotas for select nutrients not normally found in large quantities. The inference of competition between algal types is less a relevant argument when inherent species-specific metabolic pathways, bio-limiting intracellular elemental quotas, and genetic tolerances to physical parameters (turbulence and UV irradiance) appear to be a more compelling explanation for the palynofloral turnover. Partially restricted water masses and unique geochemistry fostered prolonged stability and suitable environment for green algal dominance, optimal growth and biomass production.

Results from this high-resolution study show that sea-level rise in the intracratonic basins initiated stratification of the water masses with oxygen-depleted bottom waters, resulting in organic-carbon rich mud deposition.

No published studies exist on the banana weevil in smallholder banana and plantain systems within the Bribri-Cabécar Indigenous Territories in Talamanca, Costa Rica. These include monoculture plantain and organic banana in agroforestry systems. Concerns exist over pesticide use in plantain and conversion of agroforestry systems to monoculture plantain. Alternatives to pesticides in plantain and improved pest management in organic banana to increase profitability of agroforestry systems are needed. Such efforts must be undertaken with an understanding of the socioeconomic and agroecological context of the indigenous territories. We conducted a livelihoods analysis of cacao agroforestry systems comparing cacao to plantain and organic banana. Existing production data was integrated with data from household interviews to identify factors in the decline of cacao agroforestry systems. We also conducted a rapid rural appraisal with plantain and organic banana producers. Semi-structured interviews with 75 farmers examined current pest management practices and perceptions of pest status and biology. In plantain, 63% of farmers used combination nematicide-insecticides for banana weevil control. Most organic banana farmers (61%) did not use banana weevil management practices. We assessed banana weevil damage levels and yield in 21 organic banana agroforestry farms. Yield was correlated with damage in the banana corm cortex, and 94.7% of damage was in the cortex. To determine efficacy of pheromone traps for banana weevil management in smallholder plantain farms, we evaluated weevil damage and yield before and after 58 weeks of trapping. Traps were placed in six farms at recommended rates, and six farms without traps were controls. Weevil damage decreased by 33% in farms with traps, and did not decrease in control farms. There was no reduction in trap catches, indicating that damage reduction can occur without reduction of weevil populations.

Bosque-Pérez.; Includes bibliographical references.,"Abstract: The banana weevil is a pest on bananas and plantains throughout the tropics. No published studies exist on the banana weevil in smallholder banana and plantain systems within the Bribri-Cabécar Indigenous Territories in Talamanca, Costa Rica. These include monoculture plantain and organic banana in agroforestry systems. Concerns exist over pesticide use in plantain and conversion of agroforestry systems to monoculture plantain. Alternatives to pesticides in plantain and improved pest management in organic banana to increase profitability of agroforestry systems are needed. Such efforts must be undertaken with an understanding of the socioeconomic and agroecological context of the indigenous territories. We conducted a livelihoods analysis of cacao agroforestry systems comparing cacao to plantain and organic banana. Existing production data was integrated with data from household interviews to identify factors in the decline of cacao agroforestry systems. We also conducted a rapid rural appraisal with plantain and organic banana producers. Semi-structured interviews with 75 farmers examined current pest management practices and perceptions of pest status and biology. In plantain, 63% of farmers used combination nematicide-insecticides for banana weevil control. Most organic banana farmers (61%) did not use banana weevil management practices. We assessed banana weevil damage levels and yield in 21 organic banana agroforestry farms. Yield was correlated with damage in the banana corm cortex, and 94.7% of damage was in the cortex. To determine efficacy of pheromone traps for banana weevil management in smallholder plantain farms, we evaluated weevil damage and yield before and after 58 weeks of trapping.

The indigenous territories lie within the MesoAmerican Biological Corridor and are an active site for biodiversity conservation projects. Despite this, very little is known about their local ecological knowledge and very few efforts have included farmers' knowledge in agricultural extension projects. The objectives of this research are four-fold: (1) Understand how indigenous Cabécar farmers in three communities express local soil knowledge in their crop allocation; (2) Assess soil biogeochemical properties of the Talamanca foothills to provide useful information for agroecosystems; (3) Quantify the base cation nutrient reserves in aboveground and belowground pools in a cacao agroforestry and a shifting cultivation system to make predications about long-term sustainability; and (4) Utilize a livelihood's approach for the incorporation of socio-economic factors in biodiversity conservation projects. Several methods were employed including: participatory methods for local soil knowledge data collection; spatially balanced sampling design of soils along toposequences; and monitoring of soil primary, exchangeable, and soluble base cation pools in two agroecosystems. Farmers identify three distinct soil types within the foothill region. Each soil type is correlated with a specific landscape position and crop suitability. Soil biogeochemical patterns conclude that Typic Hapludults occupy both ridgetop and midslope landscape positions, Typic Dystrudepts and Dystric Eutrudepts occupy the footslopes, and Udifluvents and Fluventic Eutrudepts occupy the floodplain. Total Si, Ca, and K contents increase downslope. Soil under the diverse cacao agroforestry system is nutrient-poor, yet leaflitter inputs provide the necessary requirements of Ca and Mg for annual cacao harvest. A deficit of K exists due to the high K concentrations in harvested cacao husks. Land management techniques on these nutrient-poor Ultisols are needed to enhance biocycling, incorporate continuous organic matter inputs into the soil, and minimize leaching losses. A livelihood's approach identified changing trends in socio-economic factors affecting land-use decisions, including the conversion of a subsistence-based economy to cash-crop agricultural systems.

This project identified triggers that contributed to the Smoke Management Plan's success and compared them to related circumstances in the watershed restoration. Interviews were collected via a Snowball Sampling Method over a five-month period. Participants were federal, state, local, and tribal agency employees connected to the watershed. While implementation of the Smoke Management Plan demonstrated a trigger point leading to eventual collaboration, the Lapwai Basin does not yet appear to have a trigger. Without it, motivation for collaboration is lower and could impact federal funding opportunities. The entities working to improve the quality of the Lapwai watershed are making positive headway, but will have greater challenges to full implementation.",Natural resources -- Co-management -- Idaho -- Nez Percé Indian Reservation -- Case studies; Intergovernmental cooperation -- Idaho -- Nez Percé Indian Reservation -- Case studies; Water quality management -- Idaho -- Nez Percé Indian Reservation -- Case studies; Water quality management -- Idaho -- Lapwai Creek Watershed -- Case studies; Air quality management -- Idaho -- Nez Percé Indian Reservation -- Case studies,eng,"vi, 79 leaves ; 29 cm",,M.S.,University of Idaho.,https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/1j5b4no/CP71226999290001451,,,,,,,,,

The common linkage between the three papers was to conduct research that meets academic standards and results in research findings that could be applied by practitioners to develop practical design and educational solutions to practical problems. In addition, each study incorporated a collaborative approach with different communities to assist with developing and conducting studies that result in recommendations for practical applications. The abstract for each paper is included in this section. Chapter 2 Abstract Paper Title: Culturally Relevant Engineering Education (CR-EE): Exploring the Impact on Native American Elementary Students: Native Americans were the original engineers in the United States; however, they are now the most underrepresented ethnic group in the engineering profession. Recommendations for increasing their representation start with the ability to deliver culturally relevant K12 engineering education. However, relevant research is limited to theoretical strategies that lack empirical evidence. This paper describes a case study that involves the collaborative development and implementation of culturally relevant engineering educational (CR-EE) curricular activities with a Tribal Community, Tribal Teachers, and University Researchers. The following research questions guided this study: What factors engage students in the activity? How are Native American students' perceptions of engineering influenced by participating in a culturally relevant engineering design activity? How did the Tribal community and other group's involvement influence the students' responses? The case study includes two separate 3-hour events with 122 elementary students from a public school located on a Tribal reservation. Both qualitative and quantitative analysis methods were employed to evaluate questionnaires completed by students after the first event and before and after the second event. The results indicate the students' were most engaged in learning about cultural traditions from the Tribal community, the ""building and testing"" portion of the engineering activity, and collaborative learning. After participating in the CR-EE activities students were more likely to perceive engineering as relevant to their Tribe and the degree of Tribal community involvement had a significant influence on the students' responses. Findings from this study provide the preliminary steps in understanding and validating theoretical strategies, which can support approaches for representing CR-EE in K12 classrooms that serve Native American students. Chapter 3 Abstract Paper Title: Identifying the Essential Properties of Biochar for Stormwater Treatment: The goal of this research was to provide a comprehensive evaluation of two different biochars for providing treatment of stormwater pollutants and to develop recommendations for the field application of a bioretention soil media (BSM) amended with biochar (BSM-Biochar mix). The pollutants include total suspended solids (TSS), dissolved Copper (Cu) and Zinc (Zn), Total Phosphorus (TP), Total Nitrogen (TN), Ammonia (NH₃), and Nitrate-Nitrite (NO₃-NO₂). These goals were achieved by conducting an extensive literature search to identify a list of proposed Essential Properties. Specifically, those biochar physiochemical properties that indicate if a biochar is suitable for stormwater applications and may be useful in stormwater treatment design. Two biochars were selected for this study, one derived from wood (W) and the other from Kentucky blue grass feedstocks (KB), because they provide a range of Essential Properties to evaluate and compare. A laboratory study was conducted to evaluate the treatment performance of the biochars, which included: 1) jar testing and 2) flow through column testing. The results from the laboratory testing indicate: both biochars reduced TSS, Zn and Pb by >90%; the Cu removal efficiency was significantly higher for the W biochar (88% to 96%) compared to the KB biochar (47% to 78%); the NH₃ removal efficiency (56% to 77%) was statistically insignificant between the biochars; the NO₃-NO₂ effluent concentration was only significantly higher than the influent for the columns with a larger quantity of biochar in which the NO₃-NO₂ was reduced by 3% to 12%; and the W biochar reduced (24.2%) significantly more TN compared to the KB biochar (14%). Neither biochar reduced TP. The KB biochar leached TP (-150% to -341%) compared to the W biochar in which the effluent concentration was statistically insignificant compared to the influent concentration. The results from this study may have been influenced by the stormwater influent hardness concentration (277 mg/L total and 227 mg/L dissolved) as well as hydrophobic characteristics observed by the biochars. Results from the laboratory testing were used to refine the list of Essential Properties, which include organic carbon, hydrogen to organic carbon ratio, cation exchange capacity, total surface area, calcium, pH, phosphorus, and nitrogen. Chapter 4 Abstract Paper Title: Development a Specification for Bioretention Soil Media Amended with Biochar for Stormwater Treatment: The goal of this research was to develop a specification for a bioretention soil media (BSM) amended with biochar (BSM-Biochar) that provides treatment of regional pollutants of concern (POC) and could be used by practitioners to design and construct bioretention best management practices (BMPs) in the field. The POCs evaluated in this study include total suspended solids (TSS), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), ammonia (NH₃), and nitrate-nitrite (NO₃-NO₂). This study is an extension of the previous study, where the key finding from the study detailed in Chapter 3 were combined with frequent citations from bioretention literature, and the Washington State Department of Ecology requirements for custom BSM to develop a draft BSM-Biochar specification. The two biochars selected for this study were developed from wood (W) and Kentucky blue grass (KB) source materials. A flow through column testing method was used to evaluate the treatment performance of the draft specifications using different BSM-Biochar mixes. The evaluation consisted of comparing the change in pollutant concentrations between influent and effluent samples as well as comparing changes in the pollutant concentrations in the BSM-Biochar mix from the top, middle, and base layer of the columns. The experimental design consisted of creating conditions that are representative of those expected in the field including using a natural stormwater solution to simulate rainfall conditions that are expected in eastern Washington where the study was conducted. The results from the water quality testing indicate: a reduction in TSS, Zn and Pb by >96% in all BSM-Biochar mixes; a reduction of Cu and NH₃ concentration by >86%; NO₃-NO₂ leached from all the columns ranging from -53% to -48% and -48% to -33% for the columns that contained the KB and W biochars respectively. The columns that contained only the W biochar reduced TP concentrations by 21% to 26% compared the columns that contained only the KB biochar which leached TP by -77% to -110%. The trend in the treatment performances indicate that TP leaching from the KB columns declines over time while the efficacy of the W columns to reduce TP also declines over time. Results from the BSM-Biochar testing indicate that Ca and Mg cations are preferentially sorbed by the W biochar whereas Na cations are preferentially sorbed by the KB biochar. Overall, the majority of the heavy metals were retained in the top 6-inches of the BSM-Biochar mixes that contained both the W and KB biochar. The results of the column testing evaluation were used to confirm and refine the proposed specification and develop recommendations for field applications. A proposed BSM-Biochar specification is included in the Appendix. | Major professor: Frtiz Fiedler.; Includes bibliographical references.",,,,,Major professor: Frtiz Fiedler.; Includes bibliographical references.,"This three-paper dissertation attempts to address research gaps amongst stormwater management design and engineering education research.

Its successful conservation will require an understanding of its ecological functioning to determine how best to restore function to degraded sites and the social value for conservation to understand the region's priorities and preferences.

The first chapter provides a brief history of the Palouse Prairie and provides context for how it has arrived at its current degraded state. The second chapter assesses the positive and negative effects of alternative methods for presenting ecological quality to respondents within a choice experiment survey; it evaluates the significance of sociodemographic variables on whether residents choose to conserve or not conserve Palouse Prairie, and it compares the relative importance of the attributes on Palouse Prairie conservation. Economic value for Palouse Prairie conservation was determined based on a choice experiment that includes the attributes of size, ecological quality, the giant Palouse earthworm, rare plants, public access, and cost. The third chapter evaluates the interaction between sense of place and economic value. It considers perspectives on whether or not it is appropriate to use a monetary value to inform conservation decisions and it evaluates the importance, qualitatively, of the Palouse Prairie to residents and their families.

Although political transition is a natural phenomenon that continuously occurs in different regions of the world, it was not expected to occur in the Arab world.

The military was the main actor in the political transition in Tunis, Egypt and Libya, whether through forcing their presidents to leave power as in Tunis and Egypt, or dividing into two parts as in Libya, which entered the country into civil war ended by the death of Qaddafi, who was one of the longest dictatorships in the world, holding political power for more than four decades.; This study concludes that the transition in Libya was more violent than in Egypt because of the low level of institutionalization of the Libyan military institution.

Four case studies (Idaho Water Supply Banks, the Lemhi River Minimum Stream Flow and Local Water Rental Pool, the Wood River Minimum Stream Flow and Local Water Pool, and the 2005 Nez Perce Tribe Snake River Water Rights Settlement Agreement) were explored to develop an in depth understanding of each individual instream flow achievement and an overall comprehension of the legal, social, biological, and physical challenge to all instream flows. Recommendations for improving Idaho instream flows and associated water policies and law include fostering collaboration, carefully reducing water market controls while maintaining sensitivity to the human dimension, allowing individuals to hold instream water rights, maintaining seniority of water rights transferred from consumptive to instream rights, facilitating monitoring, and improving and reauthorizing the Wood River Rental Pool.",Water rights -- Idaho -- Case studies,eng,"v, 153 leaves ; 29 cm",,Ph.

Regular injections of sodium lactate stimulated the indigenous microbial community, and effectively created the conditions necessary to degrade aqueous phase TCE to ethene within the treatment area. Operations for EISB included an initial field evaluation to determine if EISB was a viable remedy for the TAN contaminant area, application of EISB as the remedy of choice at TAN, and most recently, optimization of operations applying EISB. Similar to many contaminated sites containing residual or dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPL), the greatest limitation to remedial performance is the dissolution of the residual phase material into groundwater, where it is available for biodegradation. Therefore, laboratory and field studies were designed and executed in order to evaluate bioremediation substrates that might be more effective based on their physical, chemical and/or biological properties including: (1) ability to enhance mass transfer of TCE DNAPL, (2) effectiveness for stimulating contaminant degradation, and (3) pH and microbiological impacts.; Laboratory studies indicated that whey powder was superior to sodium lactate in meeting the objectives described above and was selected for a field pilot test to compare the effectiveness of sodium lactate with whey. Similar to the laboratory studies, whey enhanced mass transfer of TCE from the residual source to groundwater by a factor of 3 to 6 compared to sodium lactate and stimulated efficient reductive dechlorination of TCE to ethene. Fermentation of the primary substrate in whey, lactose, reduced pH to less than 5.5, which reduced dechlorination efficiency. The high buffering capacity of the TAN aquifer, however, mitigated pH effects, and overall, efficient reductive dechlorination was achieved. In addition, acetate-utilizing methanogens, and not hydrogen-utilizing methanogens, which compete for dechlorinating bacteria for hydrogen were enriched and maintained using both sodium lactate and whey.

On allotted reservations, those jurisdictional lines are myriad. Tribe-State conflict is not just one of jurisdiction, but of different value systems colliding. Resolving these conflicts requires more than agreeing on jurisdiction, it requires reconciling differences between two value systems: Tribes consider water as sacred; States consider water as a resource. Cooperation and collaboration can change individual behavior that produces water quality problems. It may even create shared values. Minimizing barriers between Tribes and States, however, is not enough to achieve the Tribes' common vision of restored native fisheries where waters cross jurisdictional lines. Restoring native fisheries will require active practice of the federal trust. A reinvigorated practice of the trust--one that is more than the trust as described by federal caselaw--will observe a multicultural jurisprudence in which Tribal culture and the sacred duty owed water are as integral to the practice of the trust as are the federal courts.

Its successful conservation will require an understanding of its ecological functioning to determine how best to restore function to degraded sites and the social value for conservation to understand the region's priorities and preferences. This dissertation explores the nuances of calculating the economic value of ecological quality in six chapters. The first chapter provides a brief history of the Palouse Prairie and provides context for how it has arrived at its current degraded state. The second chapter assesses the positive and negative effects of alternative methods for presenting ecological quality to respondents within a choice experiment survey; it evaluates the significance of sociodemographic variables on whether residents choose to conserve or not conserve Palouse Prairie, and it compares the relative importance of the attributes on Palouse Prairie conservation. Economic value for Palouse Prairie conservation was determined based on a choice experiment that includes the attributes of size, ecological quality, the giant Palouse earthworm, rare plants, public access, and cost. The third chapter evaluates the interaction between sense of place and economic value. It considers perspectives on whether or not it is appropriate to use a monetary value to inform conservation decisions and it evaluates the importance, qualitatively, of the Palouse Prairie to residents and their families. The fourth chapter uses economic values from the choice experiment and generates a composite measure of ecological quality using factor analysis to assign an indirect willingness to pay for individual measures of ecological quality. The fifth chapter evaluates the importance of culturally significant plants on the Palouse Prairie through an alternative valuation methodology based on semi-structured interviews and a general population survey which focuses on the perspectives of both Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations.

In the late Georgian and Regency Periods, the evolution of a particular gown reflected the political, social, economic, and religious attitudes and movements of the time. The white, round gown made from Indian muslin grew to popularity in the last decade of the 18th century. Originating in France then moving across the Channel to England, I demonstrated how changes in the round, muslin gown reflected socio-political events occurring during the period from 1799 to 1828. In the 1820s the fashion was declining and by 1830 gone from the world of dress in the nation and beyond. Contemporary women's journals of the era provided articles including images of current fashion. These sources offered primary information in a form from which data could be extracted and tabulated. Points were assigned to each garment based on the ""Classification System for Types of Dress and their Properties"" (Classification System) created by Mary Ellen Roach-Higgins and Joanne B. Eicher and the features suggested by Alden O'Brien; columnar shape, low neckline, high waistline, and white muslin fabric. For each image a zero per feature matching the criteria requisite to distinguish it a Regency gown was charted. For features such as attachments to enclosures indicated by Roach-Higgins and Eicher, one to three points were assigned. For example, if the skirt had a flounce it was given one point. More than one attachment increased the points for that skirt (enclosure for the lower body). The same method was applied to the bodice and sleeves as necessary. In viewing the data table created it was possible to see how and when the fashion was modified during the twenty-eight-year span of time. Consulting contemporary culture via historical accounts offered insight into what may have prompted a minimal or greater alteration in style. The table illustrates how the specific features of the gown morphed throughout the years. The greatest alteration occurred in the shape of the gown, which declined by 84% from columnar to a bell-shaped form, then the waistline which dropped by 48% from a very high waist to one that rested at or very near the natural waistline. The neckline and fabric (muslin) declined by 42% and 24% respectively. The feature with the least percentage of adjustment was the color of the gowns at 6%. Attachments to the enclosures signified the greatest change. Flounces on the skirts were the first to emerge followed by quilling and mancherons on the bodice. Each of these components increased over the period until there were multiple flounces, appliques, and puffings, on most gowns. As the attachments were added, the width of the skirt grew, the waistline dropped, the neckline rose, and the shoulders broadened. New fabrics and colors emerged also. The Regency gown of the early nineteenth century was gone by 1828. | Major professor: Meyer, Sonya S.

This tension between their cultural understanding of how the world works and what is taught in the classroom can create barriers to learning. Institutionalized racism and historic education policies and practices designed to assimilate American Indian students have contributed to the marginalization of American Indian students in traditional classrooms. This phenomenological study examined the affordances offered in a science classroom, when a culturally sustaining pedagogy (CSP) was used to teach physical science, biology and environmental science concepts. CSP is a framework for instruction that creates an environment where trust is established and student worldviews are honored enabling teachers and students to examine the role of race and social inequity in the learning process. This study provides an overview of a curriculum that teaches WMS concepts using CSP with a pit house (subterranean earth lodge) as the focal point for learning. The study examines the lived experiences of six purposefully selected American Indian high school students, discussing the practical and theoretical implications for CSP through the lens of Critical Race Theory (CRT) and Tribal Critical Theory (TribalCrit). Methods used in this study included interviews, sacred mapping, journaling and sharing circles. The study gives voice to the student experiences as well as shedding light on the role of the teacher (author of the study) as a facilitator for creating a culturally sustaining learning environment. Several themes emerged from the interviews including connection to community and family, the politics of identity and racism in school, and agency/self-efficacy in science. The results of this study indicate that CSP is a useful tool for creating a space for learning where student identity and cultural expression are valued. The conclusion discusses the practical and theoretical significance of the study particularly regarding teacher behaviors and interconnections between race, racism, identity and sense of efficacy in science.

The federal government has belatedly recognized its failure as fiduciary trustee, and the harm it has caused to Tribal fisheries and trust resources by the construction of federal dams and the permitting of public and private dams in the Columbia River Basin. The federal government has yet to fully recognize the harm its failure to fully discharge its general trust responsibility causes. In the absence of the general trust's vigorously wielded protective shield, States seek and press every advantage they can to diminish Tribal sovereignty and blur jurisdictional lines. On allotted reservations, those jurisdictional lines are myriad. Tribe-State conflict is not just one of jurisdiction, but of different value systems colliding. Resolving these conflicts requires more than agreeing on jurisdiction, it requires reconciling differences between two value systems: Tribes consider water as sacred; States consider water as a resource. Cooperation and collaboration can change individual behavior that produces water quality problems. It may even create shared values. Minimizing barriers between Tribes and States, however, is not enough to achieve the Tribes' common vision of restored native fisheries where waters cross jurisdictional lines.

Estell ; Frank Michael Wilhelm, 1968- degree supervisor.",2019,,Natural Resources,,"Abstract: Understanding the role of an invasive species and its interactions with native species can be difficult. Invasive Eurasian milfoil has become established in the southern end of Coeur d'Alene Lake, also known as Chatcolet Lake, Idaho, and has become a nuisance for lake managers and the public. Managers with the Coeur d'Alene Tribe observed herbivory damage to the milfoil and native macrophyte species, but the cause was unknown. Nectopsyche albida larva, a native caddisfly, has been observed concurrently with herbivory. To uncover this possible connection, I examined three facets of its ecology; life history development, diet, and feeding rate and preference of N. albida larva. I collected samples in the summers of 2017 and 2018. Overall, the combined results reveal that caddisfly larva are univoltine, with adult emergence and a new generation hatching in mid-summer each year, though the exact timing is variable. The larva progress through five instars, and they consume mainly macrophytes. Their consumption is seemingly without species preference and the diet composition and feeding rate are dependent on season and life cycle development. The larva also use macrophytes to build their cases. It is highly likely that the caddisflies contribute to the observed herbivory damage of macrophytes. However, because N. albida larva do not appear to target any specific macrophyte species and the timing of their life-cycle poorly matches that of milfoil, they will unlikely be a significant component of management strategies for milfoil in Chatcolet Lake, Idaho. | Major professor: Frank Wilhelm.; Includes bibliographical references.",,,,,Major professor: Frank Wilhelm.; Includes bibliographical references.,"Abstract: Understanding the role of an invasive species and its interactions with native species can be difficult.

This study consisted of a mixed methods analysis to determine if the students on the Duck Valley Indian Reservation in southern Idaho experienced a positive change in attitude toward math and science due to their participation in the 2010 NASA SOI, both in the short-term and over a three-year period. Specifically, the quantitative analyses consisted of single-subject visual analysis, a paired-samples t-test, and a factorial ANOVA to analyze baseline and follow-up surveys conducted before and immediately after the summer program. Also, a qualitative case study was conducted to determine if the NASA SOI had a lasting impact on the students' positive attitude toward math and science, three years after the completion of the program. The results of the quantitative analyses did not indicate a statistically significant effect of the summer program on the attitudes of the students with respect to science and mathematics over the course of the program (time), between genders, or a combination of both time and gender. However, the narratives derived from the case study indicated the students' attitudes toward science were increased following their participation in the summer program.
